<h3> main project: </h3>

<h4> Come With Me to Angola </h4>
Aug 2022 <br>
With this project we were champions at the <Academia de Código_> Hackathon in August 2022.
<br>
//Product Concept<br>
To help Angola grow after everything it has been through, our idea was to create a Volunteer Agency called "Come With Me", in which people could sign up to volunteer in Angola, choosing the time and type of purpose they would like to help.
Our team consultants would combine these forms with an Organization and project that already exists to help Angola. With that, we could help join forces to rebuild Angola.

//Tecnologies and Tools<br>
Java, Spring Boot, MVC, Maven, REST, H2 Database, SQL, React, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Agile Methodologies, SCRUM, Kanban
