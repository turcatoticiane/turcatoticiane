Hi, beautiful person! Welcome to Tici's projects space 💁‍♀️

  - 💻 I'm a <Code Cadet> @ <Academia de Código_>
  - 📓 I'm current learning a lot of different frameworks to work in Java (I love learning new things and testing them)
  - ⚔ In my personal life, when I decide to do something, I put all my efforts on it
  - 💬 I have a lot of ideas and expected to share them with my collegues
  - 🍻 My perfect free time is enjoying a sunny day with my family and friends
